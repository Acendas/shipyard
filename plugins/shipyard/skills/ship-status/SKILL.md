# Shipyard Status Dashboard

Read all project state, validate it, auto-fix issues, and present a clear dashboard.

## Context

!`shipyard-context path`
!`shipyard-context diagnose`

!`shipyard-context view config`
!`shipyard-context view sprint`
!`shipyard-context view sprint-progress`
!`shipyard-context view backlog`
!`shipyard-context view metrics 50`
!`shipyard-context debug-count`
!`shipyard-context view sprint-handoff`
!`shipyard-context status-counts`

**Paths.** All file ops use the absolute SHIPYARD_DATA prefix from the context block. No `~`, `$HOME`, or shell variables in `file_path`. No bash invocation of `shipyard-data` or `shipyard-context` — use Read / Grep / Glob. **Never use `echo`/`printf`/shell redirects to write state files** — use the Write tool (auto-approved for SHIPYARD_DATA).

## Input

$ARGUMENTS

If arguments specify a section (sprint, backlog, health, spec, diagnose), show only that section in detail.
If no arguments, show the full dashboard.
If project not initialized → "Project not initialized. Run /ship-init to get started."

**diagnose section** — when invoked as `/ship-status diagnose`, print only the resolver diagnostic block from the context above (SHIPYARD_DATA, PROJECT_ROOT, PROJECT_HASH, env vars, .auto-approve.log tail). This is the self-serve format for filing actionable bug reports about permission prompts or state divergence. Include a one-line interpretation note: if `AUTO_APPROVE_LOG=(does not exist)` the auto-approve hook has never fired for this project; if `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA=(unset)` the resolver is using its discovery probe or legacy fallback.

---

## Step 1: Validate & Auto-Fix (silent)

Before showing the dashboard, run health checks and fix what can be fixed automatically. Do NOT prompt the user for each fix — just fix it and report what was fixed at the bottom of the dashboard.

### Check 1: Frontmatter Schema

Use Glob to enumerate every `.md` file under `<SHIPYARD_DATA>/spec/` (substitute the literal SHIPYARD_DATA from the context block), then Read each one and validate frontmatter:

**Feature files** — required: `id` (F+digits), `title` (non-empty), `type` (feature), `epic` (string), `status` (proposed|approved|in-progress|done|deployed|released|cancelled), `story_points` (≥0), `complexity` (low|medium|high|""), `token_estimate` (≥0), `rice_reach` (0-10), `rice_impact` (0-3), `rice_confidence` (0-100), `rice_effort` (>0), `rice_score` (≥0), `dependencies` (list), `references` (list), `tasks` (list), `created` (date)

**Task files** — required: `id` (T+digits), `title` (non-empty), `feature` (valid feature ID), `status` (pending|in-progress|done|blocked|needs-attention), `effort` (S|M|L), `dependencies` (list). The `needs-attention` status is set by the operational fix-findings loop or the research dispatcher when escalation triggers — it means "prior attempt produced a full audit trail but the task did not converge; needs a human decision." Distinct from `blocked` (waiting on an external dependency). See `references/task-kinds.md` for the escalation semantics.

**Bug files** — required: `id` (B+digits), `title`, `status`, `severity`

**Idea files** — required: `id` (IDEA+digits), `title`, `status`

**Epic files** — required: `id` (E+digits), `title`, `status`

**Auto-fix:** Backfill missing fields with defaults where safe (e.g., `dependencies: []`, `references: []`, `tasks: []`). Log unfixable issues (wrong type, invalid status).

### Check 2: ID & Reference Integrity

- Duplicate IDs → log as error (can't auto-fix — user must rename)
- Broken dependency refs → remove invalid IDs from `dependencies:` array
- Feature references non-existent epic → clear `epic:` field
- Task references non-existent feature → log as error
- Bidirectional dependency mismatch → add missing back-reference

### Check 3: Backlog Consistency

- IDs pointing to done/released/in-progress features → remove from BACKLOG.md
- IDs pointing to non-existent files → remove from BACKLOG.md
- Old multi-column format → migrate to ID-only format
- Rank order doesn't match RICE → re-sort (unless override reasoning exists)

### Check 4: Sprint Consistency

- Task IDs not matching real files → remove from SPRINT.md
- Wave assignments violating dependencies → log as error
- SPRINT.md has old data columns → migrate to ID-only format

### Check 5: Git Alignment

Skip if not a git repo. Otherwise:
- Features marked `done` without commits → log as warning
- Features marked `released` without tags → log as warning

### Check 6: File Hygiene

State files use the soft-delete sentinel pattern: overwrite with a "cleared" marker rather than physically deleting. The relevant hooks treat the sentinel as inactive.

- Empty spec files → Edit frontmatter to `obsolete: true`
- Orphan task files (not in any feature's `tasks:` array) → log as warning
- Epic files with `features:` arrays → remove the array (membership is derived)
- Stale `<SHIPYARD_DATA>/.loop-state.json` → Write `{"cleared": "<iso>", "events": []}`
- Stale `<SHIPYARD_DATA>/.active-session.json` (>24h old) → Write `{"skill": null, "cleared": "<iso>"}`
- Stale `<SHIPYARD_DATA>/.compaction-count` file (legacy — the counter now lives on the execution lock) → use the Bash tool to `rm` it if present; it's dead state from an older plugin version.
- `<SHIPYARD_DATA>/.active-execution.json` — Read it, parse JSON. If `cleared` is set, ignore. Otherwise: if `started` is >2h old, Write the cleared sentinel automatically; if <2h, show it in the dashboard and AskUserQuestion: "Execution lock found ([skill], started [time]). Still running? (yes, leave it / no, clear it)". On clear, Write the cleared sentinel (which also clears any `compaction_count` field on the old lock).

### Check 7: File Size Health

- `metrics.md` > 300 lines → quarterly rollover. Read the file, split off the older content, use Write to create `<SHIPYARD_DATA>/memory/metrics-[quarter].md`, then use Edit to truncate the original `metrics.md` to the current quarter only.
- `BACKLOG.md` > 200 lines → archive completed items by Edit (remove their IDs); the underlying feature files keep their `status: done|released` and are reaped by `reap-obsolete` after retention.
- `reconcile-log.md` > 200 lines → Read it, then use Write to overwrite with the last 10 entries.

**All fixes are silent.** The dashboard shows a summary line at the bottom: "Auto-fixed: N items" with a brief list. Only use AskUserQuestion for destructive ambiguous issues (duplicate IDs, tasks referencing deleted features).

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

 → [Most important thing to do right now]
   [Specific command or action to take]
```

## Next Action Priority

Determine the single most important action:
1. **RESUME** — HANDOFF.md exists → "Run /ship-execute to resume from [task]"
2. **DEBUG** — active debug sessions → "Run /ship-debug --resume"
3. **BLOCKER** — blocked task needs human input → "Unblock [task]: [reason]"
4. **REVIEW** — completed work waiting for approval → "Run /ship-review"
5. **EXECUTE** — sprint has unstarted tasks → "Run /ship-execute"
6. **PLAN** — approved features but no sprint → "Run /ship-sprint"
7. **DISCUSS** — proposed features need refinement → "Run /ship-discuss [ID]"
8. **GROOM** — backlog health issues → "Run /ship-backlog groom"
9. **IDLE** — nothing pending → "Run /ship-discuss to explore new features"

## Rules

- Compute ALL metrics from **source files** (feature files, task files) — never from aggregate views
- Never guess or use placeholder numbers
- If a section has no data, say so briefly — don't show empty tables
- Always end with NEXT ACTION
- Flag issues: ⚠️ warnings, ❌ blockers
- Keep output scannable — tables and bullets, no paragraphs
- Auto-fix silently. Only AskUserQuestion for destructive ambiguous issues.
- Append fixes to `<SHIPYARD_DATA>/reconcile-log.md` (use Read to get current contents, then Write back with the appended line — one line per fix with date)
